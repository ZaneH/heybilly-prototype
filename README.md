## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get HeyBilly up and running on your Discord server:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ZaneH/HeyBilly.git
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   Use Conda to create a new environment specifically for HeyBilly:
   ```bash
   conda create -n heybilly python=3.10 -y
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   conda activate heybilly
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**
   Install all the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Setup Environment Variables**
   
   Rename `.env.sample` to `.env` and populate it with your own API keys.

6. **Fine-Tune the Model**
   
   Go to https://platform.openai.com/finetune and create a new fine-tuning job. Use the files in `./fine_tune_data` to train the `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106` model. Once finished, copy the model ID and update your environment variables accordingly.

7. **Run HeyBilly**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

Invite your bot with the following permissions replacing `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with your bot's client ID:

```
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&permissions=39584569264128&scope=bot
```

## Usage

After setting up, just join a voice channel and use `/connect` to make Billy join the voice channel too. Ensure that HeyBilly has the necessary permissions to join and speak in your voice channels.

You can use `/voice` to see a list of all the voice commands available to you.
